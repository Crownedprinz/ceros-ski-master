# Ceros Ski Code Challenge

Welcome to the Ceros Code Challenge - Ski Edition!

For this challenge, we have included some base code for Ceros Ski, our version of the classic Windows game SkiFree. If
you've never heard of SkiFree, Google has plenty of examples. Better yet, you can play our version here:
http://ceros-ski.herokuapp.com/

Or deploy it locally by running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

There is no exact time limit on this challenge and we understand that everyone has varying levels of free time. We'd
rather you take the time and produce a solution up to your ability than rush and turn in a suboptimal challenge. Please
look through the requirements below and let us know when you will have something for us to look at. If anything is
unclear, don't hesitate to reach out.

**Requirements**

- **Fix a bug:**

  There is a bug in the game. Well, at least one bug that we know of. Use the following bug report to debug the code
  and fix it.

  - Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Load the game
    1. Crash into an obstacle
    1. Press the left arrow key
  - Expected Result: The skier gets up and is facing to the left
  - Actual Result: Giant blizzard occurs causing the screen to turn completely white (or maybe the game just crashes!)

- **Write unit tests:**

  The base code has Jest, a unit testing framework, installed. Write some unit tests to ensure that the above mentioned
  bug does not come back.

- **Extend existing functionality:**

  We want to see your ability to extend upon a part of the game that already exists. Add in the ability for the skier to
  jump. The asset file for jumps is already included. All you gotta do is make the guy jump. We even included some jump
  trick assets if you wanted to get really fancy!

  - Have the skier jump by either pressing a key or use the ramp asset to have the skier jump whenever he hits a ramp.
  - The skier should be able to jump over some obstacles while in the air.
    - Rocks can be jumped over
    - Trees can NOT be jumped over
  - Anything else you'd like to add to the skier's jumping ability, go for it!

- **Build something new:**

  Now it's time to add something completely new. In the original Ski Free game, if you skied for too long,
  a yeti would chase you down and eat you. In Ceros Ski, we've provided assets for a Rhino to run after the skier,
  catch him and eat him.

  - The Rhino should appear after a set amount of time or distance skied and chase the skier, using the running assets
    we've provided to animate the rhino.
  - If the rhino catches the skier, it's game over and the rhino should eat the skier.

- **Documentation:**

  - Update this README file with your comments about your work; what was done, what wasn't, features added & known bugs.
  - Provide a way for us to view the completed code and run it, either locally or through a cloud provider

- **Be original:**
  - This should go without saying but donâ€™t copy someone elseâ€™s game implementation!

**Grading**

Your challenge will be graded based upon the following:

- How well you've followed the instructions. Did you do everything we said you should do?
- The quality of your code. We have a high standard for code quality and we expect all code to be up to production
  quality before it gets to code review. Is it clean, maintainable, unit-testable, and scalable?
- The design of your solution and your ability to solve complex problems through simple and easy to read solutions.
- The effectiveness of your unit tests. Your tests should properly cover the code and methods being tested.
- How well you document your solution. We want to know what you did and why you did it.

**Bonus**

_Note: You wonâ€™t be marked down for excluding any of this, itâ€™s purely bonus. If youâ€™re really up against the clock,
make sure you complete all of the listed requirements and to focus on writing clean, well organized, and well documented
code before taking on any of the bonus._

If you're having fun with this, feel free to add more to it. Here's some ideas or come up with your own. We love seeing
how creative candidates get with this.

- Provide a way to reset the game once it's overðŸ¥‡
- Provide a way to pause and resume the game ðŸ¥‡
- Add a score that increments as the skier skis further
- Increase the difficulty the longer the skier skis (increase speed, increase obstacle frequency, etc.)
- Deploy the game to a server so that we can play it without having to install it locallyðŸ¥‡
- Write more unit tests for your code

We are looking forward to see what you come up with!

# Ceros Ski Code Challenge

Ski till you fly. This is an amazing challenging application where clean coding, unit testing and reusability is key. I have to admit, it took a bit to figure out how the whole game works, and it definitely activated some thinking process and coordinates study.
You can check out my version at https://cerosja.herokuapp.com
Implementations:

- BugFixes

  - When you press the right arrow key or left arrow key, skier keeps moving right or left respectively
  - When you hit an obstacle and press the left key the game does not crash and the skier continue moving

- Additional Features
  - Re-implemented the codebase with Typescript
  - Added Dependency injection with typedi framework
  - Added unit test for rhino and skier services
  - The skier can jump by either the up key and the skier can jump over a rock while in air.
  - A Rhino will appear after an amount of time and chase the skier
  - If the rhino catches the skier, it's game over and the rhino will eat the skier.
  - You can pause the game with the spacebar
  - Added reset feature that can be invoked at any point in the game. Known issue: when game is over, the reset button has to be pressed twice
  - Deployed the app to https://cerosja.herokuapp.com using github workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment
  - Added Score
  - Added Sound when dead
  - Added Background sound
- Known issue
  Fixed left down and left right navigation
  Fixed Score when in crashed state

  - Known issue: if skier hits rock and game is paused. if game is resumed, skier moves instead of stucked to the tree

- Known issue
- Music does not stop when game is paused
- Music does not reset when game has reset
- Music does not continue after it has finished

Rhino comes out and eats you (regardless of your skiing skills!) once a certain score is reached
Speed is dynamically increased based on time
Score multiplier is also dynamically increased based on speed
Your score gets added to the leaderboard if you beat the high score (number 1 on leaderboard)
Jumping works with the "Space" key
Pausing works with the "P" key
Bug fixed for game crash on hitting left after a crash
Pause menu implemented with buttons
Stats section
Leaderboard section
Play button disables itself when you die, forcing you to press restart
Bootstrap for some style! No, I'm kidding i'm not a good designer, but it still looks pretty good.

Bugs:

The animation for skier being eaten by the rhino isn't quite right, something is off.
There is a bug (which I don't know how to reproduce yet) where when you restart, the game immediately starts and ends
as a death, with the menu popping up again. Not sure whats up with that
Another bug (seems to happen in tandem with 2) where the leaderboard gets messed up and doubled
The skier always starts down-right or straight down, but not down left/
The canvas does not adjust to page resizing :(
The player stops before the rhino gets to him... still debugging this one

Missing:

No unit testing. I'm not fully confident in my design choices on how I split up the classes. I might have "set myself
up for failure" with the structuring and don't want to keep you waiting on the unit tests as well. I'm expecting worse
case scenario to involve some redesigns
Jumping does NOT clear rocks! :/
Definitely could be refactored some more

Some of the struggles of this was in the setup believe it or not. Setting up webpack was a new experience, as i've used
gulp and grunt in the past. It was a steep learning curve, and threw a lot of issues my way. The same can be said for
the menu, as well as learning canvas. I also ran into some issues with setting the code up, initially I tried doing it
with named exports but I wasn't really understanding it too well, so I figured i'd go the class route. It didn't occur
to me to do it with React or Angular, so I just kept it minimal. The collisions system is still something i'm not too
familiar with, although I understand the rectangle portion, I know it can be overhauled quite well to have the same
function check obstacles and rhino collisions, but in this case I just copied the method.
MOST Jqeury methods were replaced with standard JS since jquery isn't as popular as it used to be, but some I left in.
Also, bootstrap uses it.
